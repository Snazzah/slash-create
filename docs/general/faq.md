# FAQ

## Terminology

### What are **initial messages**?
Any first response sent out during the "Sending command..." message. The initial response can be a plain message or a deferred message.

### What is a **deferred message**?
A deferred message is an acknowlegement that the message will soon be edited later on. A deferred message has been sent if the response is the "Bot is thinking..." message.

## Common Problems

### `ts-node` can't load commands from folders!
`ts-node` only compiles other TypeScript files that are imported directly and because of this, no other files are compiled and therefore not recognized. You will need to use `tsc` in order to compile everything or try [ts-devscript](https://npm.im/ts-devscript) for development environments.

### My attachments aren't showing!
Attachments cannot be sent within **ephemeral messages** and **initial messages**. You should also make sure that the files are sending **buffers**.

```js
ctx.send({
  content: 'hello',
  file: {
    name: 'avatar.png',
    file: fs.readFileSync('avatar.png')
  }
});
```

## External Libraries

### How can I get the client from my slash command?
slash-create does not support passing a client through the command context, since the library is also used for webservers.
You can do either of the following work-arounds:

#### Extend the Command Class
This requires you to manually register the command as `registerCommandsIn` will fail with commands with these constructor parameters.
```js
// bot.js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const { SlashCreator, GatewayServer } = require('slash-create');
const ClientCommand = require('./commands/command.js');

const client = new Discord.Client({ /* ... */ });
const creator = new SlashCreator({ /* ... */ });
creator
    .registerCommand(new ClientCommand(client, creator))
    // ...
```
```js
// commands/command.js
const { SlashCommand } = require('slash-create');

module.exports = class HelloCommand extends SlashCommand {
    constructor(client, creator, opts) {
        super(creator, opts);
        this.client = client;
    }

    // now you can use this.client ...
}
```

#### Requiring the client itself
```js
// bot.js
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const { SlashCreator, GatewayServer } = require('slash-create');

const client = new Discord.Client({ /* ... */ });
// ...

module.exports = client;
```
```js
// commands/command.js
const { SlashCommand, CommandOptionType } = require('slash-create');
const client = require('../bot.js');

module.exports = class HelloCommand extends SlashCommand {
  // ...
  async run(ctx) {
    // do stuff with the client...
  }
}
```

### MessageEmbed files don't work with this!
slash-create doesn't support `discord.js`'s MessageEmbed out of the box.
You can still use the builder as such, however any files attached to the builder will not be handled and should be included in the message options instead.
```js
// Regular embed
const embed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
  .setTitle('Hi')
  .setColor('RANDOM')
  .setTimestamp()
  .setDescription('Hello');

ctx.send([
  embeds: [embed]
])
```
```js
// Embed with files
const embed = new Discord.MessageEmbed()
  .setTitle('Look at this image')
  .setImage('attachment://coolimage.png');

ctx.send([
  embeds: [embed],
  file: {
    name: 'coolimage.png',
    file: fs.readFileSync('coolimage.png')
  }
])
```

### My bot sent a message but it's still thinking.
Make sure that you have updated `slash-create` to the latest version. There is a pretty good chance you are **creating the message outside of the interaction**, which does not show that the interaction has been completed. (by editing the deferred message or using `ctx.send`)

**Please make sure to use `ctx.send` or return a message (string or MessageOptions) when finishing your command interaction. Any `.send` functions outside of `ctx` will not finish the interaction.**
